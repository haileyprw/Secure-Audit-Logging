# Secure-Audit-Logging

Part 1:
1.	Any event that involves any form of authentication is logged, any attempts to access something that the user does not have access to is logged. Any system errors or attempts to modify user rights are logged. 
2.	Only authorized users can read the log, administrators and those who are given access by administrators.
3.	The logs are written to a protected read only log file.
